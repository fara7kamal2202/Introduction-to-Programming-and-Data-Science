## Project Overview  
This repository serves as the course materials for a foundational course in programming for data science. 
- Load, clean, transform and analyze datasets.  
- Use data-science tools (e.g., data frames, visualization, simple models) to glean insights.  

## Course Objectives  
By the end of this course, participants should be able to:    
- Work with structured data (CSV, Excel, JSON) and perform data cleaning and manipulation.  
- Use visualization to explore data and communicate findings.  
- Apply introductory techniques of data science: summarization, basic statistical measures, simple predictive thinking.  
- Write reproducible code and document analysis workflows.
